# FEniCS examples for the 2022 ULI software workshop
This repository contains several code examples to accompany a single-lecture introduction to finite element analysis (FEA) using the [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) software framework, with a primary target audience of engineering graduate students interested in multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO).  The examples all focus on the Poisson equation as a model problem, and should be studied in the order
* `poisson-basic.py`
* `poisson-energy.py`
* `poisson-polar.py`
* `poisson-deforming.py`

This corresponds to the order in which they are discussed in the lecture, presented at a virtual software workshop on 4 February 2022, as part of a NASA-funded University Leadership Initiative (ULI) on eVTOL optimization.  The main website for the ULI is [here](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/uli/).

Examples are all based on FEniCS version 2019.2.0.
